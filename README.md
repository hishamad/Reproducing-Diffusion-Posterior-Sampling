# Reproducing-Diffusion-Posterior-Sampling

In this project, we are reproducing and investigating the results from the paper "Diffusion Posterior Sampling for General Noisy Inverse Problems".

To run the non-linear blur experiment:
```
git clone https://github.com/VinAIResearch/blur-kernel-space-exploring bkse
```
